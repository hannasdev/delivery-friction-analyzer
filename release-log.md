## Unreleased

### 2026-06-09 - Local GitHub Analysis Command

- What changed: Added a documented local command that runs live GitHub collection, normalization, metrics, and Markdown/JSON report generation in one workflow.
- Why it matters: Maintainers can now point the analyzer at a GitHub repository and generate the MVP report artifacts without preparing a metrics summary by hand.
- Who is affected: Maintainers and contributors running repository delivery-friction analysis locally.
- Action needed: Authenticate with `gh`, provide a repository profile, and choose a local output directory for generated artifacts.
- PR: #6
